# CS 340 Client/Server Development

The original program was developed using Apporto, a virtual machine managed by SNHU. I utilized Jupyter Notebook, the Linux terminal, and mongo shell to load the csv into a collection, create multiple users, and create CRUD methods to interact with the database. I used the Dash framework to create a simple webpage for a better user experience.  In the original final project there was only a simple CRUD program with the MongoDB credentials hard coded into the file, and the dash application which had a simple user interface that allowed the user to page the through the document, select an a row, radio buttons to sort the document depending on the rescue type, and a map that would show the location of the where the selected animal was rescued from.
