# Artifact Two: Data Structures and Algorithms
The dashboard application selected as my artifact also serves as an excellent representation of my skills in data structures and algorithms. Originally developed as part of my coursework in CS 340 Client/Server Application, the application interacts with a MongoDB database to manage and analyze data related to an animal shelter. The application performs various operations, including filtering, sorting, and searching through large datasets, making it a suitable project to demonstrate my understanding and application of data structures and algorithms.

## Justification for Inclusion
This artifact is included in my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms and data structures in a real-world application. The project involved optimizing CRUD operations, indexing strategies, and implementing complex queries to enhance the performance of the application. These enhancements illustrate my proficiency in applying algorithmic principles to solve practical problems, such as reducing the time complexity of database operations and ensuring the application can handle large datasets efficiently.

## Course Objectives Met
The enhancements made to this artifact meet the course objectives related to data structures and algorithms. Specifically, I focused on optimizing the application’s performance by implementing efficient data structures and algorithms. For example, I added indexing to the MongoDB database to reduce query times, which is a critical improvement given the potentially large size of the animal shelter’s data. Additionally, I refactored the code to incorporate more efficient algorithms for sorting and filtering data, ensuring that the application can scale as the dataset grows.

## Process and Learning
Enhancing this artifact involved a deep dive into the existing codebase to identify inefficiencies in the algorithms and data structures used. I began by analyzing the performance of the CRUD operations and identified bottlenecks related to database queries. To address these issues, I implemented indexing strategies that reduced the time complexity of search operations from O(n) to O(log n) in some cases. I also refactored the code to use more efficient data structures where appropriate, such as replacing linear searches with binary searches in specific contexts.

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that these optimizations did not compromise the functionality or usability of the application. For instance, while adding indexes significantly improved query performance, I had to carefully manage the trade-offs related to the additional storage space and potential impact on write operations. This experience reinforced my understanding of the importance of balancing algorithmic efficiency with practical considerations in software development.

Through this process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the impact that well-designed data structures and algorithms can have on the overall performance and scalability of an application. The enhancements made to this artifact demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems, making it a valuable addition to my ePortfolio.
