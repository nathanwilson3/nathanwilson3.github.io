## Artifact One: Software Design and Engineering
The artifact I selected for my ePortfolio is a dashboard application designed for managing and analyzing data from an animal shelter. This application was originally created as part of my coursework in CS 340 Client/Server Application, during which I was tasked with developing a software solution that allowed users to interact with a MongoDB database, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The dashboard was built using Python, Dash, and MongoDB, providing a user-friendly interface to facilitate the management and analysis of the shelter’s data.

## Justification for Inclusion
I selected this artifact for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it showcases my skills and abilities in software design and engineering. The project involved designing and developing a full-stack application that integrates front-end and back-end components, illustrating my capability to build robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems. The enhancements I made to the artifact focused on improving the application’s architecture, optimizing performance, and enhancing the user interface to ensure a seamless experience. These improvements demonstrate my proficiency in software engineering principles and best practices, such as modularity, code reusability, and user-centered design.

## Process and Learning
The process of enhancing this artifact involved several key steps. First, I conducted a thorough code review to identify areas for improvement, focusing on software architecture, performance, and user experience. I then refactored the code to improve modularity and maintainability, breaking down large functions into smaller, reusable components. I also optimized database queries to reduce latency and improve the responsiveness of the application. Additionally, I enhanced the user interface by implementing a more intuitive design, ensuring that the application is accessible and easy to use for non-technical users.

Throughout this process, I faced several challenges, such as balancing the need for new features with the constraints of the existing codebase. I also had to consider the impact of each enhancement on the overall performance and maintainability of the application. These challenges helped me deepen my understanding of software engineering principles, particularly in the areas of software architecture and user-centered design. The experience reinforced the importance of thorough testing and iterative development in delivering high-quality software.
