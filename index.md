These experiences have taught me the importance of effective communication, particularly when working with diverse teams that include both technical and non-technical members. I have learned to listen actively, provide constructive feedback, and integrate various perspectives to achieve the best outcomes. For example, in CS 310 - Collaboration and Team Project, we created a jukebox application as a class.  To do this we utilized version control within the Eclipse IDE, which was linked to Atlassian, a Git repository service.  Everyone was able to see other branches and see what kinds of improvements they had made, as well as being able to offer advice to other people and help them solve issues they were having.

## Communicating with Stakeholders

Effective communication is crucial in computer science, especially when conveying complex technical concepts to stakeholders who may not have a technical background. Throughout my coursework, I have consistently focused on improving my ability to translate technical jargon into clear, understandable language. My capstone project, which includes detailed documentation and user-friendly dashboards, showcases my ability to communicate complex data effectively. Whether through written reports, presentations, or code documentation, I have demonstrated my ability to adapt my communication style to suit different audiences and contexts.

# Original Artifact

# CS 340 Client/Server Development

The original program was developed using Apporto, a virtual machine managed by SNHU. I utilized Jupyter Notebook, the Linux terminal, and mongo shell to load the csv into a collection, create multiple users, and create CRUD methods to interact with the database. I used the Dash framework to create a simple webpage for a better user experience.  In the original final project there was only a simple CRUD program with the MongoDB credentials hard coded into the file, and the dash application which had a simple user interface that allowed the user to page the through the document, select an a row, radio buttons to sort the document depending on the rescue type, and a map that would show the location of the where the selected animal was rescued from. Through my approved enhancement proprosal, I used an MVC (Model, View, Controller) model to make the program more modular and scalable. By doing this I was able to create a program that could easily interface with a MongodB database, use a pie chart or graph to display vital information, and for instances that need geolocation data plotted, display a map and pin of the geolocation utilizing Google Maps. I also made it easier to perform CRUD operations from the user interface of the dash app, where the original version you were unable to do that through the user interface.

These enhancements illustrate my proficiency in applying algorithmic principles to solve practical problems, such as reducing the time complexity of database operations and ensuring the application can handle large datasets efficiently.

![Crud Operations](https://github.com/nathanwilson3/nathanwilson3.github.io/blob/main/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structure/Create%20operation.png)

## Course Objectives Met
The enhancements made to this artifact meet the course objectives related to data structures and algorithms. Specifically, I focused on optimizing the application’s performance by implementing efficient data structures and algorithms. For example, I added indexing to the MongoDB database to reduce query times, which is a critical improvement given the potentially large size of the animal shelter’s data. Additionally, I refactored the code to incorporate more efficient algorithms for sorting and filtering data, ensuring that the application can scale as the dataset grows.

![Unit tests](https://github.com/nathanwilson3/nathanwilson3.github.io/blob/main/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structure/Crud%20unit%20test.png)

## Process and Learning
Enhancing this artifact involved a deep dive into the existing codebase to identify inefficiencies in the algorithms and data structures used. I began by analyzing the performance of the CRUD operations and identified bottlenecks related to database queries. To address these issues, I implemented indexing strategies that reduced the time complexity of search operations from O(n) to O(log n) in some cases. I also refactored the code to use more efficient data structures where appropriate, such as replacing linear searches with binary searches in specific contexts.

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that these optimizations did not compromise the functionality or usability of the application. For instance, while adding indexes significantly improved query performance, I had to carefully manage the trade-offs related to the additional storage space and potential impact on write operations. This experience reinforced my understanding of the importance of balancing algorithmic efficiency with practical considerations in software development.

Through this process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the impact that well-designed data structures and algorithms can have on the overall performance and scalability of an application. The enhancements made to this artifact demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems, making it a valuable addition to my ePortfolio.

# Artifact Three: Databases
The artifact I selected for my ePortfolio to demonstrate my skills in databases is a dashboard application designed for managing and analyzing data from an animal shelter. This application, originally created as part of my coursework in CS 340 Client/Server Application, interacts with a MongoDB database to perform various operations, including data storage, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD). The application also supports complex queries to filter and analyze the shelter’s data, making it an ideal project to showcase my database management skills.

## Justification for Inclusion
I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it exemplifies my proficiency in database design, management, and optimization. The project required not only setting up and managing a MongoDB database but also optimizing the database to handle large volumes of data efficiently. I focused on improving the database's performance through the implementation of indexing, optimized queries, and bulk operations. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design and manage databases that are both scalable and efficient, meeting the needs of real-world applications.

![Dash app 1](https://github.com/nathanwilson3/nathanwilson3.github.io/blob/main/Databases/Dash%20app%20screenshot%201.png)

## Course Objectives Met
The enhancements made to this artifact align with the course objectives related to databases. Specifically, this project demonstrates my ability to implement and manage a NoSQL database (MongoDB) effectively, ensuring that the database can handle large datasets and complex queries. By optimizing the database’s performance through indexing and query optimization, I demonstrated a strong understanding of database management principles and best practices. These improvements are critical in ensuring that the application can scale with the increasing amount of data it needs to manage.

## Process and Learning
The process of enhancing this artifact involved several key steps focused on optimizing the database. Initially, I conducted a thorough review of the existing database structure and identified areas for improvement. One of the first enhancements was the implementation of indexing strategies to improve query performance. By creating indexes on frequently queried fields, such as animal_id and breed, I was able to significantly reduce query times, which is essential when dealing with large datasets.

![Dash app graph and map](https://github.com/nathanwilson3/nathanwilson3.github.io/blob/main/Databases/Dash%20app%20screenshot%202.png)

Additionally, I optimized the application’s data retrieval processes by implementing projections in the queries. This approach allowed the application to fetch only the necessary fields from the database, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving overall performance. I also incorporated bulk operations to handle large data updates and deletions more efficiently, further enhancing the database's performance and scalability.

One of the challenges I encountered was balancing the trade-offs between read and write performance when implementing indexing. While indexes significantly improve read performance, they can also slow down write operations due to the additional overhead of maintaining the indexes. This experience taught me the importance of carefully considering the specific needs of the application when designing and optimizing a database.
